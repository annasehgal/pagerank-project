# Name : Anna Sehgal
# so with this I will be using implementation from networkx for pagerank
# reference: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank.html
# the goal is to generate the .out files in tests-python which I can later cross check with my .out files for accuracy of my implementaiton
